# Providers are now separated out into their own file. Version and source
# constraints for these providers are still set in the `versions.tf` file.

# Here we also set the default tags used in all our projects, 
# mandatory tags are already included, and should not be removed. The 
# project-id tag is set to null as a default. If it needs to be set, that happens
# in main.tf.
# Optional tags are in comments below:
#  app-repo   = "name of GitHub repo for app that depends on this infrastructure"
