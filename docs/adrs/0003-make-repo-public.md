# 3. Make repository public

Date: 2022-09-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Infrastructure repositories are by default private, but can be make public with a security review and approval from the team. 

## Decision
This repository is made public.  It has no sensitive data, and is an example of things we do well including:
* it shows off OIDC connections to github for actions
* shows off modules within repos in terraform
* shows where and how we come up with actions and makefile commands we end up using our public application repos

## Consequences

This repository is in the public record, care should be taken to ensure no sensitive data is committed here.
